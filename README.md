Cloth2Coin–Powered by The Second Fold Project:
Problem:
Many people have piles of unused clothes in their homes, while others lack basic clothing. There’s no simple way to connect these two sides in a sustainable way.
Our Solution
Cloth2Coin is a platform that encourages people to donate old clothes. In return, they receive digital tokens ("coins") as rewards. These tokens can be redeemed, donated, or used for future benefits. The collected clothes are either donated to orphanages or can be used as a discount in local market.

How It Works
1.	User opens the app and books a pickup slot with the number of cloths mentioned.
2.	Our team arrives and collects the clothes from their doorstep.
3.	The weight or quality is recorded, and tokens are credited to the user depending on the quality of the clothes.
4.	Clothes are delivered to verified NGOs or recycled.
